# CARRIER SUPPRESSION ERROR TEST
# We estimate the carrier suppression error finding the DC offset of the samples. The constellation is systematically translated  by a fixed vector.
# We estimates the average translation vector.The cs value is the residual carrier power normalized to the tx average power.
# # This test analize a global traslation of the constellation.
# We compare the theoretical CS value  with the probe_cs estimation.vv

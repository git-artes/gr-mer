     * \brief Quadrature Imbalance Error for QAM. 

     * QUADRATURE IMBALANCE ERROR FOR QAM. 
     *
     * We estimate the quadrature imbalance error qe finding the horizontal and vertical angle of the constellation displacement. 
     * We assume that the displacement of the cosntellation points has the following axes symmetry. 
     * If the constellation has for example these two points: x+jy and -x+jy, a vertical quadrature error moves the points to x+j(y+u) and -x+j(y-u). 
     *
     * In order to estimate the qe error we use the following outer constellation points: right up point,right down point, left up point. 
     * With the first and the second ones we estimate the vertical angle and with the first and the third ones we estimate the horizontal angle. 
     * We give the angles in radians. 
     *
     * The estimation of the qe error uses the di vector (see ste.cc). 
     * This vector has the distance between the theoretical symbol point and the corresponding mean point of the cloud of this symbol point. 
     * If there are other linear distorsions (carrier suppression and amplitude imbalance) do not influence the calculation of qe errors. 
     * update_qe returns void but the angles are passed by reference to the function. 
     * quadrature error object is called  to update qe with each sample received. 
     *
     * This class uses the demapper class to find the four outer constellation points.

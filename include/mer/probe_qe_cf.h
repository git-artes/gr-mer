    * QUADRATURE IMBALANCE ERROR FOR QAM. 
    *
    * We estimate the quadrature imbalance error qe finding the horizontal and vertical angle of the constellation displacement. 
    * We assume that the displacement of the cosntellation points has the following axes symmetry. 
    * If the constellation has for example these two points: x+jy and -x+jy, a vertical quadrature error moves the points to x+j(y+u) and -x+j(y-u). 
    *
    * In order to estimate the qe error we use the following outer constellation points: right up point,right down point, left up point. 
    * With the first and the second ones we estimate the vertical angle and with the first and the third ones we estimate the horizontal angle. 
    *
    * The block gives the angles in radians. 
    * If there are other linear distorsions (carrier suppression and amplitude imbalance) do not influence the calculation of qe errors.

* With each new sample updates STE,STEM,STED and outs its values, the block has one input float and three output flows. 
* Each d_nsamples send a message with the last STE,STEM,STED estimations for the corresponding messages ports.

* This class uses demapper.cc class to clasify to the constellation points of the received samples.

    * SYSTEM TARGET ERROR - STE. 
    *
    * For each of the dim_constellation symbol points calculate the distance d_di between the theoretical symbol point and the corresponding mean point of the cloud of this symbol point. 
    *
    * d_di is called Target Error Vector (TEV).This vector indicates the presence of distortions like Carrier Suppression, Amplitude Imbalance, Quadrature Error and may be other non-linear distortions. 
    *
    * We define the first output of the block STE as the average of abs(d_di) over the constellation points : sum_{i=0}^{dim_constellation-1}(abs(d_di[i]))/d_dim_constellation. 
    * We define the second output: System Target Error Mean STEM as the STE normalized to the average Tx power STE/tx_power. 
    * We define the third output System Target Error Deviation as the standard deviation over the constellation points: STED = sqrt(sum_{i=0}^{dim_constellation-1}abs(d_di[i])/d_dim_constellation/tx_power^2- STEM^2). 
    * Averaging of the d_di vector is implemented with a first order IIR filter with parameter d_alpha.
